# Graph DFS Implementation (Python)

This repository contains a Python implementation of an undirected graph using an adjacency list representation and Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal.

## Features
- Graph representation using adjacency lists
- Support for undirected edges
- Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Handles cycles using a visited set
- Includes multiple test cases for demonstration

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Data Structures (Graph)
- Algorithms (Depth-First Search)
- Recursion

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the files.
3. Run the program using the command below:

```bash
python assign3p2.py
